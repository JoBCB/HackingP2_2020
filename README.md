## NEARNESS IN THE NETWORK

> “The notion of the near as what is spatially proximal is being remodeled into a notion of the near as what is socially proximal—what we feel is relevant to us socially, regardless of whether it is spatially near or far. For people on the privileged side of the digital divide, the near is no longer bound by space, but instead is something that is constructed through our participation in digital networks. These networks are not antisocial, but highly social. They do not necessarily attempt to do away with the spatially near (the local) but in fact promise us a renewed relationship with it (in addition to new relationships with the spatially far or the global).” Ulises Mejias, Off The Network
 

In times of physical distancing, what could it mean to be socially near? The current time of crisis and confinement has reconfigured our appreciations of proximity.Being physically bound to various geographic locations, we are forced to move much of our communication to the online realm. In this process, we redefine social distance and nearness in our networks in terms of informational availability, from the sender to the receiver, from the server to the client. From us to you. But as we shape spaces of collectivity online, we are equally shaped by them. And as the nodes draw closer, who is recognised as a node in the network? And how can we prioritize collective agency within these constraints? 
 

Usually the kind of interactions that are possible in a network are inscribed through a protocol. Protocols are series of explicit rules that define what kind of communications are possible. During this course, we will be turning our attention to protocols that govern networked communication, but also protocols that are present within our own artistic practices. We will be working with a peer-to-peer protocol in order to explore other forms of networked interaction and the kind of relationships that it enables.
 

Various forms of hacking are critical gestures towards pervasive, invasive networks and established protocols, and have been manifested either by disrupting existing network protocols or through the creation of alternative ones. The different material provided in Hacking P2 aims at presenting different perspectives, methods and contexts around ‘hacking’ communication protocols and to explore how that may inform student’s practices and interests. We will be looking at examples from mail art, contemporary internet artists, various artist networks and radical networked practices. 
 

*For Hacking P2 we will be focusing on the following:*

* discussing different possibilities and ways of using communication networks;

* looking around at the protocols we use in daily life and within our practices — how do they work? how do they set the conditions for communicating? how do they affect working and personal relations? what can change?

* networks in relation to communication protocols;

* the power dynamics enabled by communicationp rotocols;

* peer-to-peer protocols: if everyone is a host, what does it mean to be hospitable to each other?

* seeding urls as work of affinity; seeding as bringing closer and making support structures;

* prioritizing collective and individual agency;
